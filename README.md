‚ôüÔ∏è Chess Game
A simple yet functional chess game built from scratch.
This project focuses on the core mechanics of chess while keeping the codebase lightweight and easy to expand.

‚ú® Features
Chessboard Rendering: Fully responsive, interactive chessboard.

Coordinates Display: Ranks (1‚Äì8) and files (a‚Äìh) are shown clearly.

Legal Piece Movement: All pieces can move and capture following standard chess rules.

Square Highlighting: Selected piece's square is highlighted for better UX.

Hint Squares: After selecting a piece, all possible legal move squares are visually hinted.

FEN Loading: Load any game position instantly using a valid FEN (Forsyth‚ÄìEdwards Notation) string.

Move Validation: Movement respects chess rules such as piece-specific movement, captures, and blocking by other pieces.

(More minor improvements may exist that reflect attention to detail and user experience.)
